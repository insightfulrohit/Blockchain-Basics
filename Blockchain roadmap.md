## BLOCKCHAIN ROADMAP

## ⚠️ REALITY CHECK (READ THIS TWICE)

* **40–50 LPA in Blockchain Security is NOT entry-level**
* It is paid to people who:

  * Can **read complex Solidity code**
  * Can **break production protocols**
  * Can **write audit-quality reports**
  * Can **prove skills publicly**
* Timeline is **18–30 months**, not 6 months.
* Anyone promising faster = **lying or selling a course**

If you accept this → continue
If not → stop here

# 🧱 HOW COMPANIES ACTUALLY HIRE BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY AUDITORS

Before roadmap, you MUST understand **how you’ll be judged**.

### Companies do NOT care about:

❌ Certificates
❌ Degrees
❌ Udemy completion
❌ “I know blockchain”

### Companies DO track:

✅ Your **GitHub**
✅ Your **public audit reports**
✅ Your **bug bounty history**
✅ Your **code reviews**
✅ Your **CTF / contest rankings**
✅ Your **writing (blogs / explanations)**

Think like this:

> “If I disappear today, what proof exists that I can audit a smart contract?”

If answer = **nothing**, you are unemployable.

---

# 🔍 HOW COMPANY TRACKING SYSTEM WORKS (SIMPLE)

### Step-by-step reality:

1. **You apply OR recruiter finds you**
2. They open:

   * GitHub
   * Twitter/X
   * Blog
   * Sherlock / Code4rena profile
3. They check:

   * Have you **found real bugs?**
   * Can you **explain issues clearly?**
   * Do you **understand attack impact?**
4. Shortlisting happens in **10–60 seconds**

If your public footprint is weak → resume not even read.

# 📤 WHAT YOU MUST UPLOAD (MANDATORY)

| Platform      | What to Upload                                  |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| GitHub        | Solidity code, vulnerable examples, audit notes |
| Medium / Blog | Write-ups of vulnerabilities                    |
| Code4rena     | Contest participation                           |
| Sherlock      | Audit contests                                  |
| Immunefi      | Bug bounty submissions                          |
| Twitter/X     | Technical breakdowns (optional but powerful)    |

No uploads = invisible.

# 🩸 BLOCKCHAIN ROADMAP (ZERO → AUDITOR)

I’ll give **MONTH-WISE**, not vague.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 0–1: COMPUTER + PROGRAMMING BASICS (NO SKIP)

If you skip this, you will FAIL later.

### Learn:

* Linux basics (terminal, permissions, processes)
* Git & GitHub (commit, push, PR)
* Programming logic

### Language:

**Python OR JavaScript** (pick ONE)

Why?

* Tooling
* Automation
* Understanding logic

📌 Output required:

* GitHub repo with:

  * Simple scripts
  * Notes in README

If you can’t do this → blockchain will destroy you.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 2–3: WEB & CRYPTOGRAPHY BASICS

### Learn:

* How internet works (HTTP, APIs)
* What is:

  * Hashing
  * Encryption vs Encoding
  * Digital signatures
* Wallets, private keys, seed phrases

### Blockchain basics:

* What blockchain solves (double spending)
* Blocks, transactions, nodes
* Bitcoin vs Ethereum (HIGH LEVEL)

📌 Output:

* Blog: “How blockchain works in simple terms”
* GitHub notes repo

---

## 🔴 MONTH 4–5: ETHEREUM & EVM (CORE FOUNDATION)

This is where real work starts.

### Learn:

* Ethereum architecture
* EVM basics
* Gas, storage, memory
* Accounts:

  * EOA
  * Contract accounts

### Tools:

* Remix
* Metamask
* Hardhat (basic)

📌 Output:

* Deploy your first contract
* GitHub repo with:

  * Deployment scripts
  * Notes

If you can’t deploy → you are not even a beginner.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 6–8: SOLIDITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This is the **gatekeeper phase**.

### Learn deeply:

* Solidity syntax
* Storage vs memory vs calldata
* Modifiers
* Inheritance
* Events
* Errors
* Fallback / receive
* ERC20, ERC721, ERC1155

### Write code DAILY.

📌 Output:

* 10–15 small contracts
* GitHub repo:

  * Clean code
  * Comments
  * README explaining logic

If you don’t enjoy Solidity → **QUIT NOW**.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 9–11: SMART CONTRACT SECURITY (REAL SHIT)

Now you become dangerous.

### Learn vulnerabilities:

* Reentrancy
* Integer overflow/underflow
* Access control
* Flash loan attacks
* Oracle manipulation
* Front-running / MEV
* Signature replay
* Price manipulation
* Delegatecall abuse
* Storage collision

### Learn:

* Why bug happens
* How attacker exploits
* Business impact

📌 Output:

* Vulnerable contracts repo
* Exploit PoCs
* Writeups

No writeups = no credibility.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 12–14: AUDITING TOOLS & FRAMEWORKS

### Tools:

* Slither
* Mythril
* Foundry
* Hardhat tests
* Echidna (basic)

### Learn:

* Manual audit methodology
* Threat modeling
* Reading real audit reports

📌 Output:

* Audit-style reports (PDF / Markdown)
* GitHub repo: “Audit Notes”

---

## 🔴 MONTH 15–18: PUBLIC PROOF (MOST IMPORTANT)

This is where **jobs start becoming possible**.

### Platforms:

* Code4rena
* Sherlock
* Immunefi
* Ethernaut
* Damn Vulnerable DeFi

### Goal:

* Find REAL bugs
* Even low severity is fine initially

📌 Output:

* Public profile links
* Accepted findings
* Detailed writeups

If you skip this → **no 40LPA, period**.

---

## 🔴 MONTH 18–24: SPECIALIZATION + BRAND

### Choose ONE:

* DeFi
* Bridges
* Governance
* NFTs
* Layer 2

### Do:

* Deep research
* Publish breakdowns
* Follow top auditors
* Replicate their thinking

📌 Output:

* Niche authority
* Recruiters start DM’ing

---

# 💰 WHEN DOES 40–50 LPA HAPPEN?

Based on skills, this amount can be higher or lower

* Junior auditor: 10–18 LPA
* Mid auditor (real bugs): 20–30 LPA
* Senior auditor / lead: **40–50+ LPA**

This is **performance-based**, not time-based.

---

# 🧨 FINAL BRUTAL VERDICT

If you:

* Want shortcuts ❌
* Hate reading code ❌
* Avoid writing publicly ❌
* Fear competition ❌

→ **This field is NOT for you**

If you:

* Can grind silently
* Love breaking logic
* Can explain clearly
* Can fail publicly and improve

→ You can reach **40–50 LPA**
