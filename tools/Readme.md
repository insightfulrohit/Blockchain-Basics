# 📘 Blockchain Learning Journey – Tools Repository

This repository contains all the blockchain-related tools that we will create throughout our learning journey.  
Each tool will help us:

- Make our learning practical  
- Understand concepts more deeply  
- Implement real blockchain components  
- Continuously improve our skills  

As we learn topics like **blockchain fundamentals**, **cryptography**, **smart contracts**, **Web3 security**, **nodes**, **transactions**, **hashing**, and more, we will keep adding our own tools, scripts, and small projects to this repository.

This repository will serve as our **complete blockchain learning journal**, where we will:

✔ Learn  
✔ Build  
✔ Improve  
✔ Track our progress  

**Every new topic → a new tool**  
**Every new tool → a new step in our growth**

This way, we will continue moving forward and make our blockchain journey **practical, powerful, and skill-focused**.
