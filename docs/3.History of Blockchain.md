# Before History of Blockchain

Before going further in the journey of studying blockchain, we must know the **history of blockchain**.  
But why?

Here are some reasons:

---

## 1) To understand why blockchain exists

- To solve the **double-spending problem**
- To overcome or completely remove **centralization**
- To reduce dependency on **mediators** (banks, government)

---

## 2) To understand Bitcoin’s design decisions

Bitcoin was **not built for speed or smart contracts**.  
It was built for:

- Trust minimization from centralized systems  
- Censorship resistance  
- Immutability — no one can change anything once it is recorded  

---

## 3) To understand the evolution from Bitcoin → Ethereum → Web3

- **Bitcoin** → Digital money  
- **Ethereum** → Programmable money  
- **Web3** → Decentralized applications and finance (DeFi)  

---

## 4) To avoid repeating old mistakes

Understanding past failures, limitations, and trade-offs helps prevent rebuilding insecure, centralized, or flawed systems again.

# 📜 Blockchain History

## 1) 1991 – Digital Timestamp System (Haber & Stornetta)

This was the first seed of blockchain.

They created a system in which digital documents were timestamped (date/time added) so that the original creation time and later changes could be detected and proven.

---

## Problem

There was no reliable proof of:

- Who created the original file?
- When was it created?
- Whether someone changed the file later or not?

Digital documents cannot be trusted because anyone can copy or modify them.

Even if someone says,

> "This is the original file"

there is zero trust.

---

## Why this system was not enough (limitations)

- It was not a ledger
- There was no network consensus
- There were no incentives/rewards
- Decentralization was missing
- Trust was still dependent on humans/systems, not on a network

---

## Solution

They used cryptographic hashing + timestamping.

---

## Process

- Every document was converted into a hash.
- That hash was stored along with a timestamp.
- If anyone changed the document even slightly,  
  → the hash would change instantly.

This made tampering detectable immediately.

---

## Example (Hash Linking)

- Document A → Hash A

- Document B → Hash B + Hash A

- Document C → Hash C + Hash B + Hash A
